          Darsana Bangalore Chapter has 115 members. A large part of the chapter
          members are employed in the IT. As most members are still in “Work
          from home” mode, many of our members are in Kerala. A few of the
          initiatives that Bangalore chapter has undertaken are:

        <p className={styles.darsanaJobPortal}>
          - Darsana Job Portal: Main objective of the portal is to help Darsana
          members to find a job or to move to better roles and jobs. The portal
          provides a single platform to pool in all the job requirements known
          to Darsana members across the globe. It was Inaugurated by Com.
          Krishnakumar on 8th January 2022. It was well received in the
          beginning and several job openings were put up by our members.
          Gradually the use of the portal showed a down trend. In the coming
          year, we need to brainstorm and take corrective actions to re-energise
          the platform. The job portal was designed and realized under the
          leadership of Com. Ajith Prasad, Com. Jose Varghese and Com. Arjun K P

        <p className={styles.careerExplorerTalk}>
          - Career Explorer Talk: With an objective to provide guidance to
          Engineering Students to choose their career paths after the Degree, an
          Online Expert Panel discussion was conducted. This was open to all
          Engineering students across Kerala. It was planned as a series of
          sessions to cover all the engineering branches. The first in this
          series “Career Paths in IT” was conducted on 22 Jan 2022. The
          Panelists were Com. Mukundan Annamalai, Com. ArunanThayyil and Com.
          Dinesh I. The other sessions planned in the series were put on hold in
          view as the participation from the student crowd was not high as
          expected. An analysis following the first session indicated that
          student communities, in general, are not giving priority for such
          webinars.

        <p className={styles.comMukundanAnnamalai}>
          - Com. Mukundan Annamalai conducted 2 talks to the students in NSSCE
          campus. These talks were well received by the students. The talks
          were: “Future of Information Technology” on 27th Oct 2021 and “A
          Typical day in a Large IT Organization” on 26th Nov 2021.

        <p className={styles.supportToSociety}>
          - Support To Society: With the objective of supporting the community
          we are in; a School at Kolar Gold Fields that requires our
          intervention was visited by Com. Arunan, Vineeth VS and Sathian in
          June 2022. This School has Pre-Primary, Primary and Secondary classes.
          The students are from poor backgrounds. They are the children of daily
          wagers of the area. The school is supported by the CPM for its
          operation.  The number of teachers is less than the number of the
          classes/divisions. The salary for the teachers is very low and is not
          paid regularly. There is no support up to 7th standard from the
          government and the school is managed with the meager fees of Rs.200/
          month received from students. We are in the process of identifying
          areas we could help and a plan is being made.
